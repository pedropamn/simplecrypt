<h1 align="center">Simple Crypt Tool </h1>

&rarr; __Description__ 
* A simple program that encrypt and decrypt any file with password

&rarr; __Usage__ 
* Just run executables available in Releases Tab

&rarr; __Contribute__ 
* The script was made with [PAGE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/), a GUI builder for Tkinter (One of Python GUI engines). That is, to edit GUI, edit with PAGE (it will generate ```.tcl``` GUI files itself. Don't edit ```main.py``` and ```about.py``` directly). 

The "magic" happens into ```simplecrypt.py``` and into support modules (```main_support.py``` and ```about_support.py```)
