<h1 align="center">Simple Crypt Tool </h1>

&rarr; __Description__ 
* A simple program that encrypt and decrypt any file with password

&rarr; __Usage__ 
* Just run executables available in Releases Tab

&rarr; __Contribute__ 
* The GUI part of script was made with [PAGE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/), a GUI builder for Tkinter (One of Python GUI engines). That is, to edit GUI, edit .tcl files with PAGE (it will generate corresponding python code itself. Don't edit ```main.py``` and ```about.py``` directly. These files are auto genereted by PAGE). For more details about edit GUI created with PAGE, take a look on [PAGE documentation](http://page.sourceforge.net/html/index.html)

The "magic" happens into ```simplecrypt.py``` and into support modules (```main_support.py``` and ```about_support.py```)
